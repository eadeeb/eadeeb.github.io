					<h2>About Me:</h2>
					Statistics major at <a href="https://www.stat.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>
          (BC, Canada) graduating January 2018.
          I'm currently looking for a CO-OP job for the summer term 2017 (April-September).
				 	I have interest in scientific methodology and modern statistical methods.
					I am most interested in public health and technology. I have experience working with
					geological, geomechanical, and sport data. I am interested in working and gaining experience
					on survival analysis and modern visualization methods. I have strong programming skills in R, having
					worked with supervised machine learning algorithms, mostly for kaggle competitions
					and classes but would love to gain real world application experience. Some of the Machine
					learning methods I have familiarity with
					include: Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian Model Averaging, and Nearest Neighbour.
          <br><br>
          I have completed courses in SAS, C++, and Python
					although much of my experiences has been with R. I have extensively used the dplyr library to implement
					split apply combine (paradigm) methods on a variety of data including food, sports, housing,
					and beer ratings <i class="em em-beer"></i> .	I can also produce data visualizations in ggplot2.
					My Excel skills have been sharpened through a decade of use. Though recently I have used Tableau for data
					cleaning, organization, and visualization.
					Tableau helps to stream line many processes, although I completely feel that R is far more
					useful and trustworthy in the sense of reproducibility.
					<br><br>
						I created this website to be able to communicate and share my experiences
					 	with employers, friends, family, and the internet. Born in Dubai and spent
					  most of my childhood in the middle east. I am the son of a Bahraini
						father and a Russian mother, and because of my multi-ethnic upbringing
						I can communicate in 3 languages (English, Arabic, Russian). I was
						lucky to have travelled the globe as a child and gained insight to a
						variety of cultures and people which I think allows me to integrate
						into social groups efficiently.  I moved to Vancouver, Canada
						permanently in 2006. I attended the University of British Columbia
						where I received a degree in Geological Engineering with a focus on
						soil and rock mechanics. During my time at university and post-
						graduation, I worked at a variety of consulting firms that specialized
						in geology, mining, foundations engineering. I spent much of time
						on-site at a variety of locations including Northern BC and Siberia.
						These on-site jobs became less appealing as time went on and I found
						myself asking what does the future hold? This is where I decided to
						travel to Europe and Asia. In these travels, I found what I wanted
						to do. It began with data analytics and visualization as well as
						Computing science, this later evolved into a fascination with
						applied mathematics. After a series of unsuccessful application
						to a series of technology firms, and advice from hiring managers at
						these firms, I began my journey to get a degree in statistics.
						Statistics was appealing to me because it allowed me to use tools
						and skills in a variety of fields without finding myself
						funnelled into one line of work. As I began learning more about
				 		the field my fascination with scientific methodology and technology
						began to grow and now I find myself more curious than ever
					 	with what can be achieved with proper science and efficient
						computing.
